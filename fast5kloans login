What Is a Payday Advance?

For people with bad credit, payday advance loans are a great alternative to high interest credit cards for small, short term loans. Generally, these loans are given for a short term, hence the term "payday advance," since they are meant to act as an advance of your paycheck for those times when you are short on cash. Payday loans will need to be repaid by the next payday or two, so the carry a term of 14 to 30 days.

These loans are a great option for those with bad credit since they are granted based on income rather than on credit score.
